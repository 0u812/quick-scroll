# quick-scroll

Scroll faster across Atom with the modifiers of your choice at two configurable speeds.
Also manages regular scroll sensitivity, which defaults to 40.

Modifiers are configurable in settings. By default,
use ctrl or shift for quick-scroll, or use both together for 'overloaded' scrolling.
Finally, Use alt to scroll horizontally and shift-alt to zoom the font.

Mac's cmd can be chosen as a modifier, but compatability is currently unknown. Any PR's or suggestions on the topic of mac defaults or cmd functionality would be appreciated.
