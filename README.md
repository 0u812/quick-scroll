# quick-scroll

Scroll faster across Atom with 'quick-scroll regions' or with the modifiers of your choice.

- quick-scroll regions default to 12% of the right side of an element.
- use ctrl or shift for quick-scroll
- use both together for 'overloaded' scrolling
- use shift + alt to change the font size in an editor
- use alt to scroll horizontally

Mac's cmd can be possibly chosen as a modifier, but compatibility is currently unknown. Any PR's or suggestions on the topic of mac defaults or cmd functionality would be appreciated.

Note: This package uses its own regular scroll sensitivity, which defaults to 40. Change this in the settings for this package.

## Installation

You can search for 'quick-scroll' by navigating to  `settings > install` and install from within Atom, or you can use the following command in the terminal:

`apm install quick-scroll`
